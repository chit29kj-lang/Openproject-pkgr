# Invite members

In order to see a project and work in it, you have to be a member of a project. Therefore, you have to **add team members to a project**.

<div class="glossary">

**Member** is defined as a project member in a project. Project members are added in the Members module in the project menu.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> If you are not a member of a project, you do not see the project in the Project selection nor in the project or portfolio lists.

## View members

To view the list of **all project members and their roles** in the project, select Members in the project menu on the left side. It will open a list of all the project members, including groups and external users, that work packages have been shared with.  

You can use both filters in the left hand menu, as well as the filter options next to the **+ Member** button.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you do not have a global permission to **View all users and groups **, you will not see all users of your instance.  The selection is limited to users who you share a project with or are in the same group with. 

Please also refer to [Members module guide](../../user-guide/members).

## Add existing users

To add existing users, [placeholder users](../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/placeholder-users) or groups to a project, [select the project](../projects/#open-an-existing-project) for which you want to add members. In the project menu on the left, select the **Members** module.

In the [members list](#view-members) you will get an overview of the current members of this project.

Click the **+ Member** button in the top right corner.

Type the name of the user, placeholder user or group which you want to add. You can also choose several members at once. **Assign a role** to the new member(s) and click the blue **Add** button.

Please note that you will have to click the new member's name or press the Enter key before clicking the Add button.

## Invite new members

You can also invite users who do not yet have an OpenProject account. There are different ways to do it.

**Invite in members module**

[Select the project](../projects/#open-an-existing-project) for which you want to add members. In the project menu on the left, select the **Members** module.

Type in the email address of the new member. If OpenProject does not find an existing user, the **Invite** information will automatically be put before the email address. Press the Enter key or select the text "Invite ...". Assign a role to this new member and click the blue **Add** button.

An email invitation will be sent out to the user with a link to [create an account](../sign-in-registration/#create-a-new-account) for OpenProject.

**Invite from header**

In the header menu that is always present, you find a **plus** icon that allows you to create projects, work packages and invite users from wherever in the application you are.

![Button to invite new users in the header navigation of OpenProject](openproject_getting_started_invite_new_user_header_navigation.png)

Once you click the **Invite user**, a dialogue will open. Here you can select the project, to which project you want to invite new members. Select whether the permissions assigned to the new user should be based on an existing user role, group or a [placeholder user](../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/placeholder-users/) permissions.

![Pop up form to invite new user in OpenProject](openproject_getting_started_invite_new_user_popover_form.png)

Click **Continue** to proceed. 

![Form to specify user and permissions when inviting new users to a project in OpenProject](openproject_getting_started_invite_new_user_popover_form_invitation_message.png)

If you selected *User* or *Group* in the previous step, you can either select an existing user in your instance from the dropdown list of enter an email address to invite a new one. You can then assign a specific role to that user within the project and provide context by adding an invitation message.

If you chose to add a *Placeholder user*, you can enter the name of a user to assigned a role. 

![Form to add a placeholder user to a project in OpenProject](openproject_getting_started_invite_new_user_popover_form_placeholder_user.png)

Click **Invite** to trigger an invitation. 

**Invite within a work package**

When you are working in the work package table, you can also invite users from there. For example when you want to set an assignee for a work package that does not yet have access to OpenProject, you can select the Invite option from the drop down menu. The same applies to the column Accountable or the custom fields for your project.

![Invite a user from a work package assignee field in OpenProject](openproject_getting_started_invite_new_user_from_work_package.png)

You can now collaborate with your team in OpenProject. Newly invited users will be shown with a letter symbol next to their name.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Removing a member who has not accepted the invite from a project yet will lead to the deletion of this user, which can't be reversed.

## Behavior of groups as project members

Groups have the following impact on a project members list and behave slightly different than individual users:

- the group name is shown as a separate line on the project members list
- the group members cannot be removed from the members list individually (no delete icon)
- adding a group with members who are already in a project member list will add the group's role to their (the members') project roles
- a project member belonging to a group can have additional roles added individually
- the group's role cannot be changed for individual group members

Find out more about the management of groups [here](../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/groups/).

## Behavior of placeholder users as project members

Placeholder users will look slightly different from regular users in a project member list:

- will be shown without email address
- can't be part of a group, i.e. they will be shown without group affiliation
