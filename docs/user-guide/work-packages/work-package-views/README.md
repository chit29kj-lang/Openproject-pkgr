# Work packages views

In OpenProject, a *view* is a list of work packages. Each view is based on a set of filter criteria and displays all work packages that meet those criteria. Every project in OpenProject automatically has these default views in the work packages module:

![A list of the default work package views](openproject-user-guide-work-package-views.png)

- **All open**: All open work packages (that is, with statuses that are not defined as _closed_), sorted in ascending order of ID (lowest on top)
- **Latest activity**: All work packages, open and closed, in descending order of last updated date (latest on top)
- **Recently created**: All open work packages in descending order of creation date (latest on top)
- **Overdue**: All open work packages with finish dates that are in the past in descending order of how long each is overdue (closest to current date on top)
- **Summary**: Table overview of the number of work packages grouped by type, status, priority, assignee, accountable, author, version, category and subproject
- **Created by me**: All work packages created by you (the current user) in descending order of last updated date (latest on top)
- **Assigned to me**: All work packages that are assigned to you in descending order of last updated date (latest on top)
- **Shared with users**: All work packages that have been [shared with users or groups](../share-work-packages/) (including the current user and/or external users or groups)

You can also create, save and modify your own work package views, which will be displayed under **Private** views. If you mark the visibility settings to **Public** or **Favorite**, they will be displayed under the respective views sections.  Read about [work package table configuration](../work-package-table-configuration/#save-work-package-views) to learn how.

## View modes

The work packages in any view can be displayed a number of different ways. Each of these view modes displays the same set of work packages but display them differently:

* [Table view](#table-view)
* [Split screen view](#split-screen-view)
* [Details view](#full-screen-view)
* [Gantt view](../../gantt-chart)
* [Board view](../../../getting-started/boards-introduction/)

### Table view

The table view shows all work packages in a table with selected attributes in the columns.

Find out how to make changes to the work package table view, e.g. change the titles in the header, filter, group or add dependencies in the [work package table configuration guide](../work-package-table-configuration/).

### Split screen view

In the work package table, click the **info icon** at the right end of a work package row to open the split screen view. You can also activate or deactivate the split screen view using the **info button** in the top right corner of the table, next to the Filter button.

Once the split screen is open, you can easily navigate through the work package table by clicking in a row of a work package and display the details in the split screen on the right.

### Full screen view

To display a work package with all its details in full screen mode, double click on a row within the work package table.

Also, you can use the full screen icon in the work package split screen view in the header at the right (next to Watcher).

Then, the work package with all its details will be displayed. To return to the table view use the return arrow of your browser.
