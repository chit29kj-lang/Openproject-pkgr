# Project widgets

## Project widgets overview

**Widgets** are small blocks of information that you can customize to display pertinent project information (such as project description, status, work package lists or graphs). These widgets are displayed on the project home page. 

> [!TIP]
>
> Project overview tab displays certain widgets in a pre-set layout. However, under the *Dashboard* tab you can add and remove multiple widgets, re-order them and resize them to your liking.

The description can be added or changed in the [project settings](../../projects/project-settings).

![Project description widget displayed on a project home page in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_project_overview_project_project_description_widget.png)

### Project status widget

Add your project status as a widget to display at a glance whether your project is on track, off track or at risk. You can set your project status and give a detailed description.

First, select your project status from the drop-down. You can choose between:

- On track
- Not set
- At risk
- Off track
- Not started
- Finished
- Discontinued

![Project status widget displayed on a project home page in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_project_overview_project_project_status_widget.png)

Add a **project status description** and further important information, such as project owner, milestones and other important links or status information.

### Spent time widget

The spent time widget lists the **spent time in this project for the last 7 days**.

![Spent time widget displayed on a project home page in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_project_overview_project_spent_time_widget.png)

Time entries link to the respective work package and can be edited or deleted. To have a detailed view on all spent time and costs, go to the [Cost reporting](../../time-and-costs/reporting/) module.

### Subitems widget

The subitems widget lists all subitems of the respective entity:

- Subitems of a project are subprojects
- Subitems of a program are projects
- Subitems of a portfolio are programs are projects

The *Subitems* widget under the *Overview* tab allows adding subitems directly within the widget (click the **Plus** icon in the top right corner of the widget and select *Project*). That same widget under that *Dashboard* tab lists all subitems of a project, but offers no option to add subitems directly. 

![Subprojects widget displayed on a project home page in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_project_overview_project_subitems_widget.png)

The widget only links the first subproject hierarchy and not the children of a subproject.

To edit the project hierarchy, go to the [project settings](../../projects/project-settings).

### Work package graph widgets

The work package graph widgets display information about the work packages within a project. They can be displayed in different graph views, such as a bar graph or a pie chart.

![Work packages graph widget displayed on a project home page in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_project_overview_work_packages_graph_widget.png)

**Configure the work package graph**

You can filter the work packages to be displayed in the graph according to the [work packages table configuration](../../work-packages/work-package-table-configuration/).

To configure the work package graph, click the three dots icon in the top right corner and select **Configure view**.

![Configure axis criteria for a work packages widget on a project home page in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_project_overview_axis_criteria_widget.png)

Next, select the **Chart type** how the work package information shall be displayed, e.g. as a bar graph, a line, a pie chart.

You can also filter the work packages for your chart. To do that, click the **Filters** tab in order to configure the work packages to be displayed, e.g. only work packages with the priority "high".

You can display the graph according to the following criteria:

* Type
* Status
* Priority
* Author
* Assignee

![Dropdown menu showing criteria for the work package overview widget on a project home page in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_project_overview_wp_widget_criteria.png)

The widget lists all **open** and all **closed** work packages according to this criteria.

### Work package table widget

The work package table can be filtered, grouped, or sorted according to the [work package table configuration](../../work-packages/work-package-table-configuration/), e.g. to display only work packages with the priority "High".
