# Project home page

The **Project home page** page is a dashboard with important information about your respective project(s). This page displays all relevant information for your team, such as members, news, project description, work package reports, or project status. Information on the project overview is presented using [project attributes](./project-attributes/) and [widgets](./project-widgets/).

## What is the project home page?

The project home page is a centralized overview page that displays all essential information for a selected project. Its purpose is to serve as a single source of truth for the entire project team, providing quick access to key data and project progress.

You can access the project overview by navigating to **Project home** in the project menu on the left.

On the project overview page you will see the following sections: 

1. [**Overview** tab](#project-overview) is pre-configured set of [project widgets](project-widgets) to provide a concise summary of the project’s status. 
2. [**Dashboard** tab](#project-dashboard) provides access to all available widgets and allows full customization of layout and content according to user preferences. 
3. [Project life cycle](project-life-cycle)
4. [Project attributes](project-attributes)

Here you can also [mark a project as favorite](#mark-a-project-as-favorite) or [archive](#archive-a-project) it. 

## Project overview



![Pre-set project widgets on the overview tab of the project home page](openproject_user_guide_project_home_overview_tab.png)

The **Overview** tab is a pre-configured to provide a concise summary of the project’s status. Its layout is fixed and cannot be modified. It includes the following widgets: 

  - [Description](./project-widgets/#project-description-widget)

  - [Project status](./project-widgets/#project-status-widget) 

  - [Subitems](./project-widgets/#subitems-widget)  

  - [Members](./project-widgets/#members-widget) 

  - [News](project-widgets/#news-widget)  

  - Optional: [Project attributes](project-attributes). 
    
    >  [!TIP]
    >
    > Project attributes are usually displayed under the **project life cycle** section on the right, but a project attribute section can also be placed centrally under the pre-defined widgets. This placement can be changed under system administration.

## Archive a project

You can archive a project directly from the project home page. To do that click the **More** (three dots) icon and select *Archive project*.

> [!NOTE]
> This option is always available to instance and project administrators. It can also be activated for specific roles by enabling the *archive_project* permission for that role via the [Roles and permissions page](../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/roles-permissions/) in the administrator settings.

You can also archive a project under [project settings](../projects/project-settings/project-information/#archive-a-project) or in a [projects list](../projects/project-lists/).
