# Frequently asked questions (FAQ) for project home page


## When I set up the overview page for a project, work packages can be arranged as a Gantt chart. I would also need this for the subprojects. How does it work?

If you have selected the "Work package table" widget on the under the *Dashboard* tab of the home page, you can open the *more (three dots)* menu at the top right corner of the widget and click **Configure view**. In the configuration, you can select subprojects under *Filter*. You can choose all subprojects, a single subproject, or several subprojects.  

In the *Gantt chart* tab of the Work package table configuration, tick the box next to "Show Gantt chart". All work packages of the selected subprojects will then be displayed in a combined Gantt chart view.  

If you want to see the individual Gantt charts of the subprojects separately, you need to add a Work package table widget for each subproject.

## Can I change or re-arrange the widget on the project home page?

The layout of widgets on the **Overview** tab of the project home page is pre-set and **cannot** be changed.  

You **can**, however, add, edit, and re-arrange all widgets on the **Dashboard** tab of the project home page.
